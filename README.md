# scripts_vcf
Scripts to handle and filter VCF files (intended for personal use)

In order to make these scripts work you need to set the environment variable SCRIPTSVCF_DIR to indicate the directory where they are located, HUMANDB_DIR to indicate where the reference human genome is located for annovar and SNPSIFT_DIR to indicate where the file SnpSift.jar from the SnpEff package is located.
